# Covid-19-Detection-with-X-ray-Images-and-Transfer-Learning-Techniques

The novel coronavirus (covid-19) with a starting point
Wuhan, China has spread rapidly amongst countries all around the
globe. There are approximately 22 Million confirmed cases as of
August 2020. Compared to the daily rises in cases, there are few
covid-19 testing kits available. There is a need for testing kits and
some countries and regions are in much more need than others. Due
to the lack of testing kits available to the public, it is necessary to
implement a detection system as an alternative diagnosis method for
covid-19. With rapid advancements in medical image processing
techniques, the development of intelligent prediction and diagnosis
tools have also increased at a rapid rate. Machine learning
techniques are widely accepted as a prominent tool to improve the
prediction and diagnosis of many illnesses such as cancer. In this
study, a dataset of X-ray images from patients with common bacterial
pneumonia, confirmed Cd-19 disease, and normal incidents is
utilized for the automatic detection of the Coronavirus disease. The
procedure of transfer learning was adopted using three different
computer vision models that were pre-trained on thousands of
images from ImageNet. The models used for this specific purpose are
VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet101. The dataset was generated by
gathering different classes of images and combining them to form a
dataset of size 1GB for better accuracy.
